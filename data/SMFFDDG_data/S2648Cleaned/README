The original S2648 dataset was checked for sequence similarity
using: blastall -p blastp -i S2648.fasta -d S2648.fasta -m8 -e 0.01 -o S2648.All-vs-all.blast.e0.01 

The blast output is: S2648.All-vs-all.blast.e0.01

Then we clusterize the sequences using the connected components with edge at 25%
The cluster is: S2648.cluster.25
From this cluster, we generated a random partition that groups the proteins of the same cluster in the same set. 
Finally, the resulting S2648 dataset is available at ./SMFFDDG_data/S2648_with_cluster_fold.csv, which includes a "fold" column to indicate the fold assignments.
